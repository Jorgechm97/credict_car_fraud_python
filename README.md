# Credit Card Fraud Analysis with Neural Networks ⚡🔍

## Introduction
This exciting data analysis project focuses on detecting fraud in credit card transactions using advanced Deep Learning and Neural Network techniques. Leveraging the power and predictive ability of these models, we explored the Kaggle dataset to identify fraud patterns in the financial sector.

## Data Set 📦
The valuable data set used is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) and provides extensive information on credit card transactions, essential for our fraud analysis .

## Objectives 🎯
- Implement Deep Learning models to identify and predict fraudulent transactions.
- Use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to improve fraud detection in the financial sector.
- Leverage oversampling techniques (SMOTE) to address class imbalance in the data and improve model effectiveness.

## Code Structure 💻
The Python code used is divided into sections that range from data exploration and preprocessing to the construction and evaluation of Convolutional Neural Networks. Libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, Matplotlib and Scikit-learn, among others, are used.

## Featured Results 🌟
- Effective identification of fraudulent transactions thanks to the use of Deep Learning models and Neural Networks.
- Significant improvement in fraud detection accuracy through the implementation of CNN.
- Successful application of advanced techniques to address class imbalance and optimize model performance.
